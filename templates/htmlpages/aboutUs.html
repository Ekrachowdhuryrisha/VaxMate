  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p> VaxMate is a student-developed web platform designed to empower families across Bangladesh with comprehensive vaccination management tools. Born from the need for accessible, reliable healthcare solutions, we created a user-friendly system that bridges the gap between families and essential vaccination services.<br>


Our platform offers more than just remindersâ€”it's a complete vaccination ecosystem. From intelligent scheduling that accounts for age-appropriate vaccines to real-time updates on government immunization programs, VaxMate ensures you never miss a critical dose. Our family tracking feature allows parents to monitor vaccination records for children, elderly relatives, and extended family members all in one secure dashboard.<br>


Built with the local context in mind, VaxMate integrates with Bangladesh's national vaccination calendar and provides location-specific information about nearby health centers, mobile vaccination units, and special immunization campaigns. We partner with local health authorities to deliver accurate, timely information that families can trust.<br>


Our mission is simple: make vaccination management as easy as checking your email. By combining modern technology with healthcare expertise, we help families stay protected, reduce missed appointments, and contribute to building a healthier Bangladesh. Join thousands of families who trust VaxMate to keep their loved ones safe and healthy.<br>
